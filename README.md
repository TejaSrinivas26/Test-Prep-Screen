# Test-Prep-Screen

This repository contains the design files for a visually appealing, user-friendly, and intuitive test prep screen created in Figma. The design is specifically tailored for an AI-driven software that helps users prepare for standardized tests. The interface aims to provide an engaging and effective learning experience.

Features
The test prep screen design includes the following key features:

Problem Display: Users can view a problem statement along with multiple-choice options. The design ensures readability with clear typography and appropriate spacing. Visual indicators are used to highlight the selected option.

Tutor Chat Interface: Users can interact with the AI tutor through a chat interface. The design includes chat bubbles that display the conversation between the user and the AI tutor. User messages are aligned to the right, while tutor messages are aligned to the left, ensuring clear communication.

Gamification: The design incorporates a points or progress system to motivate users and track their progress. The points or progress indicator provides a visual representation of how much progress the user has made, adding a gamified element to the learning experience.

Responsiveness: The design is built to be accessible, responsive, and adaptable to various screen sizes and devices. It ensures a seamless user experience across different devices, making test preparation convenient and accessible on the go.
